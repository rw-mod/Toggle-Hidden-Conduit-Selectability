# Hidden Conduit Selectability (1.6 Update)

This is an **updated version** of the [original "Hidden Conduit Selectability" mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3393599165), updated to support **RimWorld 1.6**.

The original mod added a toggle button to the map overlay UI, allowing players to choose whether **Hidden Conduits** (invisible power lines) should be selectable in the game. This updated version keeps the same functionality while simplifying the implementation.

---

## âœ… Features

- Adds a **toggle button** to the top map controls that allows players to make Hidden Conduits selectable or unselectable.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Differences from the Original Mod

- Updated for **RimWorld 1.6** compatibility.
- Replaced the **Harmony Transpiler patch** with a **simpler Postfix patch** using `DoMapControls`, making the code easier to read and maintain.
- No changes to the core gameplay â€” only refactoring and version compatibility adjustments.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This is **not an official update** by the original author.
- Functionality is preserved 1:1 with the original â€” only the internal patching logic was improved.
- Compatible with existing saves and should be safe to add or remove mid-game.
